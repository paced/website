# paced.me

The personal profile of Tian Hao (Thomas) Wang.

## Build

This is a standard [Nuxt](https://nuxtjs.org) application.

``` bash
# First-time installation.
$ npm install

# Run for development environment.
$ nuxt

# Build for production and launch a server.
$ nuxt build
$ nuxt start

# Build static site.
$ nuxt generate
```

## Content

Content is unlikely to change and therefore is stored directly in the partials.

## Deployment

The site is built as a static site that can be deployed to a block store.
